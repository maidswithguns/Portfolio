        "description": "This game is unofficial and has no affiliation with Kadokawa or the \"Date A Live\" / \"Date A Bullet\" group. Over the past year, I have been developing \"Date A Bullet\" as a game creator alongside @Randamu3DModels as a 3D modeler. I am responsible for the programming, animation, design, etc., but the song and character design of Kurumi Tokisaki are not my creations. \"Date A Bullet\" is built using the Unity game engine and is an hack-and-slash 3D action game.",
